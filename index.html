            <h2>Skills</h2>
            <p>
                I believe I am skilled at coding and computer graphics. I am a relatively fast typer at about 80 words per minute (to 90). I know how to use Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign. I've worked with SketchUp and Floorplanner as well.

            <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
            <p>
                Some hobbies of mine are traveling, drawing, and photography. I enjoy to go camping and to explore the world. I’ve been to Cambodia, the Bahamas, and some states in the US (such as Rhode Island, Georgia, etc.).
                I am interested in snowboarding and volleyball.

            <h2>Family Life</h2>
            <p>
                I am the eldest in my family, and I have a little brother who’s about 10 years younger than me. I am apart of a Cambodian family, and we always try to incorporate it into our daily lives. I have three others in my family, my brother, my mom, and my dad. My dad works as a Graphic Designer, and I became interested in using technology.

            <h2>High School</h2>
            <p>
                I hope to be accepted to Millikan High School. I believe I will either take COMPASS (The Community of Musicians, Performers, Artists, and Social Scientists), a more artistic point of view for the future, or QUEST, which doesn’t necessarily have a specific path towards the future.
            </p>
            <h2>College</h2>
            <p>
                I have no college of interest yet, but I believe that I might return to the east coast to attend the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD). Other than that, I have no colleges in mind. 
            </p>
            <h2>Career Interest</h2>
            <p>
                A career interest of mine is to become a photographer, even if it’s not exactly everyone’s ideal job, I have a passion for photography and I would enjoy to study more about it. I believe by travelling and experiencing newer ways to view the world, it’d become easier to capture as a feeling and emotion through the camera
            </p>
            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>
                Academic goals of mine is to graduate with a GPA that I can be proud of and feel that I did my best. I’d like to get a job that I like and can enjoy and to get into a good university as well. A goal unrelated to academics of mine is to travel around the world and visit as many different places I can.
